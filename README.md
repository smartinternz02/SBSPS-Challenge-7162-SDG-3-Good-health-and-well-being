# SBSPS-Challenge-7162-SDG-3-Good-health-and-well-being
### The United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals, better known as the UN SDGs, act as a blueprint for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015. As a part of the Data for Social Good Hackathon, we aim to use relevant data to analyze, visualize and come to conclusions and possible solutions for any identified problems. One of India's goals under the goal of Good Health and Wellbeing is to reduce maternal mortality ratio by the year 2030.
### By analyzing the NFHS-5 dataset for the state of Telangana and studying the relevant key indicators carefully, we hope to uncover new and important insights pertaining to Maternal Healthcare and draw effective conclusions from it.
